## Gemini Discord Bot Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the Gemini Discord Bot on your own server. 

**Requirements:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* A Discord account and a server where you have administrator permissions.
* A Google account with access to the Generative AI API and a valid API key.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the bot's files.
    - Clone the repository using git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/praveensonesha/Discord-FitnessBot.git
    ```
    - Navigate to the newly created directory:
    ```bash
    cd Discord-FitnessBot
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
    - Add the following environment variables to the file, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
    ```
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
    ```
    - You can obtain your bot token and client ID from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). 
    - The Google API key can be obtained from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

4. **Deploy Slash Commands (Optional):**
    - This step is only necessary if you want to use slash commands (e.g., `/clear`). 
    - If you don't need slash commands, you can skip this step.
    - In the terminal, run the following command:
    ```bash
    node deploy-commands.js
    ```
    - This will register the slash commands with your Discord application.

5. **Start the Bot:**
    - In the terminal, run the following command to start the bot:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    - The bot will connect to Discord and be ready to interact with users.

**Interacting with the Bot:**

* **Direct Messages:** Send a direct message to the bot to start a conversation.
* **Mentions:** Mention the bot in a server channel to get its attention.
* **Slash Commands:** Use the `/clear` command to clear the conversation history.

**Additional Notes:**

* You can customize the bot's behavior and responses by modifying the code in the `conversationManager.js` and `config.js` files.
* The `errorHandler.js` file contains basic error handling logic. You can extend it to implement more robust error handling.
* Make sure to keep your API keys and bot token secure. Do not share them publicly. 
* Refer to the [Discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.14.1) and the [Google Generative AI documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs) for more information on the available features and options. 

**Enjoy using the Gemini Discord Bot!**
